- My sister will turn 21 in 14 days.
- Going to Nepal tomorrow for a week.  Momos, monkeys, and trekking - here we come!
- Made vegetable meals 3 times this week.
- Have been productive in programming.
- Had my first 5-star hotel experience in Bangalore.  Thank you Marriott for the free nights and the executive suite. 
- Crawfish will be plentiful and cheap this year - cannot wait for a crawfish boil.
- Less than one month until the Vietnamese New Year.  This will be the 15th year I won't be home celebrating with families.  Nostalgic!
- Finally found out where my favorite Indian cookies are sold - right across the street from the apartment. I have been hunting for them for 3 months.  Boom! 
- Not everybody in the world use toilet papers.  Many use water and left hands instead.  Not sure what to think about that (I miss my Charmin Ultra Strong).
- Raspberry black current smoothie at Cafe Colombia is addictive.
- Learned a few Nepali words.  
- Bunster got some creepy blisters playing soccer with his coworkers.  Last game he scored a goal with his head.  And sprained his hand a little too. 
- Thien's camera is a champion.  The thing survives a 3 feet fall directly onto the rocks in Hampi.
- Favorite new band:  [KUAN](http://youtu.be/iVRK1xl4gbA)
- Will be going to Turkey for a month in mid Feb.
- Heard some great news from my mom.  So proud of her and so happy for her.
- Cannot sleep well without Misa... Murrr.
- The music didn't play until 10 at night on Republic day.
