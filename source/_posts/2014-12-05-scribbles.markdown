- 2.5 months in India.
- Had a blast attending an Indian wedding in Solapur and hanging out with friends/co-workers in scenic Hampi last weekend.
- The weather has been extremely pleasant; I cannot say I miss the winter in the U.S.
- Adam got a fever last night. Poor the fur ball, too much play and not enough sleep.  
- The planning for Nepal trip in Feb is 95% done.  Tickets booked, hotels/guest houses reserved.  Only thing left is to confirm guide and porter for trekking trip.
- Two more weeks until we fly home for the break.  Way behind on Christmas shopping.  
- Breakfast and lunch are much more comforting now that the food vendors are changed in the cafeteria.  I kept finding hairs in my food with the old ones.  Haizz... and sometimes I don't think they were hairs from the head.
- Favorite Indian starter:  chicken lollipop. Succulent flavorful heaven.
- I know I'm spoiled when I cannot do business in a swat toilet.  I even sang to coax myself but it didn't work.  Bahhh.
- Always bring toilet paper when traveling in India.
- I told Adam that it would be cloudy all the time we were in Solapur and Hampi. The result?  He got some serious sunburn.  The lesson? Don't trust Thien to look up the weather.
- Cutest Indian saying: "click".  They use the word "click" instead of "take picture".  Such as:  "Will you click me?", "Nice clickworks!"
- Big banana:  5 rupees each.  Tiny banana:  5 rupees each.  What??? How could that be when they taste equally good? Oh well, bigger is better.
- I haven't seen my guava man for almost a week.  I'm worried and sad.  But that did not stop me from having an affair with another guava man who sells red-flesh guavas.  I mean, even Bunster does not blame me.
- I must confess my shame to maah spoony sister:  I eat McDonald!!!! And I like it.  The McSpicy is so good here.
- I think I'm starting to like India.
