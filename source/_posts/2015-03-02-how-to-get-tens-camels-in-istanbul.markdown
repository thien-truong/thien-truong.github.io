A day venturing to the European side of Istanbul ended with 6 sore legs, a few blisters, many loots, and 3 spent humans.

From Suadiye Residence where we stay on the Asian side, Adam, Neha and I took a dolmus (a shared taxi) to Kadikoy ferry dock then boarded a ferry to Eminonu.  Europe greeted us with a deliciously fishy smell since there were quite a few fish sandwich vendors around and along the Galata Bridge.  I was drooling excessively but Neha and Adam were not too interested.  Lucky for them we just had breakfast or I would have made them wait in agony while I slowly enjoy the treat with some pickle juice (Adam will shiver when he reads to this part, hah hah hah).

Our itinerary was basic:  Hagia Sophia Museum, Blue Mosque, Grand Bazaar, and Spice Bazaar.  Having to find our way without the GPS while walking in goopy melting snow was quite challenging, especially since Neha and I do not have snow boots.  Pretty sure I did not fall on my face because I waddled like a penguin.  We skipped Hagia Sophia due to the long line, but everything else was rewarding despite being sandwiched like sardines at the bazaars.  

A lesson that we learned the hard way during our little excursion:  Turkish salesmen are not afraid to take advantages of your courtesy to get you into their shops. One man casually made a conversation with Adam, and then politely asked if he could give Adam his business card.  What he neglected to tell us was that he didn't have the cards on hand. Upon saying yes, we were led to a shop tucked away in a small walkway.  Then he brought out some tea at lightning speed and urged us to sit down, repeatedly telling us that if we didn't, we would be insulting his culture.  Needless to say we did not touch the tea and ran out of there as fast as we can.  After a dozen time of being harassed in similar manners, we figure out that the general tactics are as followed - just as you walk by, about every shop owners will start with the classic:  Where are you from? If you reply, they prolong your attentions with a story or a series of other questions.  Eventually, the conversation will direct to how about you go inside and check out the merchandise in their shop.  My advice: either keep grinning like a baboon or practice your puzzling face so you can convincingly pretend that you have no idea what they are talking about.  

In midst of all the harassments, some of the conversations turned out rather funny and deserved to be quotes of the day.  Multiples shop owners told Adam how lucky he was to have two beautiful ladies accompanying him.  Of course their “hint hint wink wink” tones insinuated that Neha and I do more than just sight seeing with him. I made some suggestive jokes about making these men's speculations come true but Neha blushed profusely and told me she didn’t want to hear anything more on the subject. Hee hee. It didn't help that I was the only one who wants to let her off the hook. When Adam tried to tell them that Neha is just a friend, one of the men said that he would give ten camels for her.  Of course we bursted into laughter and refused his offer but then I wondered: how many camels would I get for trading in Adam?
