Since our family vacation to the Grand Canyon last summer, Adam and I have been itching to put our hiking shoes to more use.  We had vowed to not let all the blisters it took to break them in go to waste.  Lucky us, Gurpreet (Adam's coworker) offered to take us to a half-day hiking trip last weekend.

[Sinhagad Fort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhagad)(The Lion's Fort) lies about 30 kilometers (18 miles) southwest of Pune and rises 1312 meters (4304 feet) above sea level.  Once the site of many important battles, only the traditional gates and broken walls remain today. One could opt to drive all the way to the fort, or stop at the foothills then hike up.

Gurpreet had hiked there a few times already so he suggested that we start early to avoid the afternoon sun.  He picked us up at 5:00 and we reached the base at around 6:00.  His car suffered some serious abuse due to the poor road condition.

The hike up usually takes about an hour; but with my short legs, lack of stamina and excessive picture taking, it took an hour and a half.  The climb was steep but the fresh air, huge batches of wild flowers, and the patience of my companions made everything better.  A long the way, there were a few flimsy huts that sell quick refreshments such as fresh cucumbers, pickles, boiled peanuts, yogurts...  We passed on the snacks for sanitary reasons but then later shamelessly accepted the granola bar Gurpreet offered when our feet got wobbly on the way down.

From the top we can see all the way to Pune.  The view was spectacular - everything I would have wanted for my engagement pictures if I could do it again.  On the way down, Gurpreet spotted a couple of mountain crabs.  They made me all lustful since I did not really have any shellfish since I got here.  Besides, Adam and I were famished.  Next time, we would not go without some snacks, no matter how short the hike is.
