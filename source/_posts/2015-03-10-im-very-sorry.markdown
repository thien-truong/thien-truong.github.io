Today, I permanently take off the tiger tooth pendant that I have been wearing almost every day for the past eleven years. 

A few hours ago, I was reading an [article](http://ingenira.hubpages.com/hub/A-Teary-Mother-Bear-Killed-Her-Baby-and-Committed-Suicide-A-Heart-Breaking-True-Story) about the practice of bear bile farming and was enraged and revolted by the degree of cruelty that human are capable of.  But then it hit me: I'm not any better.

All these years I repeatedly told myself that my tiger tooth probably came from a dead tiger from a zoo. Sadly, chances were that he suffered an abusive life and a painful death.  Regardless, I should have never wanted the tooth in the first place. 

What a selfish and ignorant monster I am! I paid $50 for a tooth but it might have cost a tiger his life. He did no harms to me, yet I killed him.  My pendant was once my pride, but now it's my shame.  My cruelty is the reason animals are still being violated and murdered.

Please help by telling the likes of me to STOP, NOW!

I'm very sorry, Tiger!
