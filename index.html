  <div class="entry-content"><p>So many times I want to write about our trip to Nepal last February but the words keep finding way to hide.  I lost motivation mainly because it was not as a successful trip as I had hoped, especially since I spent so much time planning for it.  So here I am, yanking out my hair writing this, hoping that if I can get all the frustrating parts out of the way, the rest would be easier.</p>

<p>To keep the trip inexpensive and allow for lots of time to relax, I opted to stay in the Kathmandu Valley area, which comprises of three ancient cities: Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur.  Our itinerary for the week was simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>Day 1, 2, 3: Arrive in Thamel. Visit Kathmandu Dubar Square, Swayambhunath, Boudhanath and Patan Dubar Square.</li>
<li>Day 4: Trek to Nagarkot</li>
<li>Day 5: Trek to Dhulikhel</li>
<li>Day 6, 7: Wind down in Bhaktapur.</li>
<li>Day 8: Go home.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://welcomenepal.com/promotional/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Entry-Fees-to-Heritage-Sites.pdf">Entrance fees</a> for most attractions are ridiculously higher for foreigners except for SAARC nationals; and the same goes for <a href="http://www.yetiairlines.com/yeti-fares.html">airplane tickets</a> to any parts of Nepal. Pokhara, a destination 200km away, was very tempting but I couldn’t justify spending $120 each way on airfare for each person, especially when the flight is only 25-minute long.  From what Adam gathered, Nepal was once an integral part of what was called the &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie_trail">Hippie Trail</a>&rdquo; – a journey travelled from Europe overland to southern Asia which the goal to be as inexpensive as possible.  Since these “hippie visitors” do not contribute much to Nepal&rsquo;s heavily tourism dependent economy, its government decides to levy high fees accross all foreigner related services.</p>

<p>The discrimination in price was already nipping at me but I held it in, until we arrived to Bhaktapur. In Kathmandu and Patan, you enter the cities and then only buy tickets if you want to see a particular sight. In Bhaktapur, tickets are required the second you step foot inside the city limit since the whole thing is considered a heritage site (which I didn&rsquo;t know). Tickets are at a hefty $15 per person; but you still have to pay extra if you want to visit the museums and such. I would not have been so angry if only the Dubar Square here could even compare to the one in Kathmandu. For twice the price, I expected a whole lot more.  What a scam!!! Thankfully we found the perfect souvenir here: an exquisite singing bowl.  I think it helped calming down my rage and disappointment; but this city definitely made my black list.</p>

<p>So except for Bhaktapur and Boudhanath and Patan Dubar Square, everything else was great.  We had the best pizza ever at Fire and Ice, and drank so many sweet lassi.  We experienced our first hookah and loved it.  We trekked until my thighs were chafed and my toenails turned purple (my hiking shoes does not like the fact that my index toes are a lot longer than my big toes - CREEPY!).  All in all, we were glad we made the trip.  Mistakes made and learned; and we are one country richer than before we left.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, I permanently take off the tiger tooth pendant that I have been wearing almost every day for the past eleven years.</p>

<p>A few hours ago, I was reading an <a href="http://ingenira.hubpages.com/hub/A-Teary-Mother-Bear-Killed-Her-Baby-and-Committed-Suicide-A-Heart-Breaking-True-Story">article</a> about the practice of bear bile farming and was enraged and revolted by the degree of cruelty that human are capable of.  But then it hit me: I&rsquo;m not any better.</p>

<p>All these years I repeatedly told myself that my tiger tooth probably came from a dead tiger from a zoo. Sadly, chances were that he suffered an abusive life and a painful death.  Regardless, I should have never wanted the tooth in the first place.</p>

<p>What a selfish and ignorant monster I am! I paid $50 for a tooth but it might have cost a tiger his life. He did no harms to me, yet I killed him.  My pendant was once my pride, but now it&rsquo;s my shame.  My cruelty is the reason animals are still being violated and murdered.</p>

<p>Please help by telling the likes of me to STOP, NOW!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very sorry, Tiger!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A day venturing to the European side of Istanbul ended with 6 sore legs, a few blisters, many loots, and 3 spent humans.</p>

<p>From Suadiye Residence where we stay on the Asian side, Adam, Neha and I took a dolmus (a shared taxi) to Kadikoy ferry dock then boarded a ferry to Eminonu.  Europe greeted us with a deliciously fishy smell since there were quite a few fish sandwich vendors around and along the Galata Bridge.  I was drooling excessively but Neha and Adam were not too interested.  Lucky for them we just had breakfast or I would have made them wait in agony while I slowly enjoy the treat with some pickle juice (Adam will shiver when he reads to this part, hah hah hah).</p>

<p>Our itinerary was basic:  Hagia Sophia Museum, Blue Mosque, Grand Bazaar, and Spice Bazaar.  Having to find our way without the GPS while walking in goopy melting snow was quite challenging, especially since Neha and I do not have snow boots.  Pretty sure I did not fall on my face because I waddled like a penguin.  We skipped Hagia Sophia due to the long line, but everything else was rewarding despite being sandwiched like sardines at the bazaars.</p>

<p>A lesson that we learned the hard way during our little excursion:  Turkish salesmen are not afraid to take advantages of your courtesy to get you into their shops. One man casually made a conversation with Adam, and then politely asked if he could give Adam his business card.  What he neglected to tell us was that he didn&rsquo;t have the cards on hand. Upon saying yes, we were led to a shop tucked away in a small walkway.  Then he brought out some tea at lightning speed and urged us to sit down, repeatedly telling us that if we didn&rsquo;t, we would be insulting his culture.  Needless to say we did not touch the tea and ran out of there as fast as we can.  After a dozen time of being harassed in similar manners, we figure out that the general tactics are as followed - just as you walk by, about every shop owners will start with the classic:  Where are you from? If you reply, they prolong your attentions with a story or a series of other questions.  Eventually, the conversation will direct to how about you go inside and check out the merchandise in their shop.  My advice: either keep grinning like a baboon or practice your puzzling face so you can convincingly pretend that you have no idea what they are talking about.</p>

<p>In midst of all the harassments, some of the conversations turned out rather funny and deserved to be quotes of the day.  Multiples shop owners told Adam how lucky he was to have two beautiful ladies accompanying him.  Of course their “hint hint wink wink” tones insinuated that Neha and I do more than just sight seeing with him. I made some suggestive jokes about making these men&rsquo;s speculations come true but Neha blushed profusely and told me she didn’t want to hear anything more on the subject. Hee hee. It didn&rsquo;t help that I was the only one who wants to let her off the hook. When Adam tried to tell them that Neha is just a friend, one of the men said that he would give ten camels for her.  Of course we bursted into laughter and refused his offer but then I wondered: how many camels would I get for trading in Adam?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today marks India&rsquo;s 66th Republic Day - a commemoration of when India&rsquo;s Constitution came into effect on January 26th, 1950.  Each year, the Indian government invites a different foreign head of state to be its special guest.  This year, as the result of an unprecedented invitation from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the honorary goes to President Obama.  He is the first sitting U.S. President to be Chief Guest at the celebration parades in New Delhi.</p>

<p>Equally important, the theme for this year&rsquo;s parade is &ldquo;Nari Shakti&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Woman Power.&rdquo;  According to the <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2015/01/23/this-is-what-you-need-to-do-to-watch-the-republic-day-parade-with-obama/">Wall Street Journal</a>, &ldquo;while women have participated in the marching contingents before, this is the first time entire contingents from the cadres of the three armed forces (the Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force) will take the eight-kilometer long parade.&rdquo;  Hopefully, these brave and inspiring women will soon get larger roles in the forces and be allowed into combat fields.</p>

<p>At our apartment complex, the music has been playing very loudly through an amplifier since around 9:30 a.m. There is also an organized gettogether where all the kids participate in various games. From the 9th floor, I can hear every pitch of their happy screams - which are both refreshing and brain-scrambling. If past holiday experiences are any indication, this will go on until around 10 in the evening. For the people who are not accustomed to these prolonged noise exposures, you will feel quite abused.</p>

<p>Oh well, when in India, enjoy the music eh???  Happy Republic Day!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>During our break back home in December, we had to regretfully tell our food-lover friend Alan that we had not been to any open markets yet.   He didn’t give us bullet eyes, but we secretly felt shameful.   How could we stay in India for 3 months and not take our lazy bones out to an open market? Thus when we planned for our trip to Bangalore, we knew we must visit Krishna Rajendra Market – the biggest market in the city.</p>

<p>This market is usually busiest in the early morning; but by the time we got there at noon, the crowdedness did not seem to subside much.  We walked around aimlessly, almost suffocating with the vibrancy and aliveness.  A myriad of tiny shops fill both sides of the many narrow streets leading to the market center. Countless people invade the street pavements to sell fruits, vegetables, flowers, clothes, snacks, and almost everything imaginable.</p>

<p>At the center is a large complex with a glorious flower market on the underground level.  Since the people of India seem to favor garlands more than whole flower stems, heaps of flower heads are piled on the grounds, in baskets, and on low concrete stands. As I walked by, a gentleman charmingly offered me a rose head.  I wore it in my hair the whole day.</p>

<p>Our excitement and curiosity were undoubtedly visible. I was really glad that no one seemed to be bothered when I took pictures of their merchandise.  Actually, everybody was rather friendly.  As we stopped to study the many unfamiliar items at various vendors, quite a few people asked where we were from.  A fruit seller cut up a water apple for us to try even though we told him that we didn’t want to buy after inquiring about the price.  A man who sells dry goods waved me over and put a mark of red turmeric powder (a kumkuma) on my forehead.  He said gently:  “for Indian women.”</p>

<p>The kindness of his words however comforting was making me uneasy.  Sure, I was wearing a kurta&hellip; I might even pass as an Indian woman for a day, but I’m still just a stranger.  I saw the hustle bustle, the colors, the chaos; and I was amused.  I enjoyed the stroll knowing that I didn’t have to live it the next day or the day after.</p>

<p>This market is the only mean to make a living for many, but what a torment! Amidst the raw beauty lay the stench, the pollution, the lack of drainage systems, the overpopulation, and the lack of governmental support.  People lead hard lives here.  I came and I went.  Where can they go?  How long can these stemless flowers survive?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dosa is a savory pancake made from a rice and black lentils batter and usually eaten with sambhar (lentil based vegetable stew) or chutney.  There are many types of <a href="http://food.ndtv.com/lists/indian-fast-food-top-10-dosa-recipes-694722">dosa</a>, but the most famous of them all might be the masala dosa: a dosa with sautéed potato and onion filling.</p>

<p>Before coming to India, I had a dream: to eat enough dosa to last me a lifetime since where else can I find better dosa than at its birthplace.  Thus naturally I ordered a cheese paper masala dosa for my first meal in Pune. What a sight it was when the waiter brought out the crêpe-like monster, so big it stretched across two dinner plates.  I tore out a piece of dosa, scooped up some potato filling, dipped it in the sambhar, put it in my mouth, and expected heaven.  Nom nom&hellip; waiting&hellip; Ehhhh, hmnn.  Nothing? Let&rsquo;s try again&hellip; Nom nom&hellip; Ehhh, hmnn&hellip; Something was not quite right here.  Where were the starburst and the mind-numbing bliss?  Why are people raving about this dish?</p>

<p><figure class='caption-wrapper' style='width:px;'><img class='caption center' src='https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-srEVBEpgKAs/VL9ZOPvjEtI/AAAAAAAAFf0/V8t4VNU8DXY/w820-h1094-no/IMG_9954.jpg' width='' height='' title='The unimpressive (flavor-wise) first dosa experience at Kalyani Veg'><figcaption class='caption-text'>The unimpressive (flavor-wise) first dosa experience at Kalyani Veg</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Well, shame on me for not doing a more thorough research for better dosa places and for giving up after just one try.  I paid the price with three dosa-less months.  Thankfully, Adam and I were saved by our weekend getaway to Bangalore.</p>

<p>While searching for a restaurant specialized in Southern Indian cuisine for dinner, Adam came across <a href="http://www.mavallitiffinrooms.com/about-us/">MTR</a> - a beloved jewel of Bangalore eateries.  The foods they serve are intended for light meals so we decided to go there for breakfast the next morning.  The quest to find this place took so much patience because I insisted to walk from our hotel instead of taking a rickshaw.  We found the street it&rsquo;s supposed to be on but pinpointing the exact location was next to impossible.  After 45 minutes of wandering around and asking 5 different people, we finally found it hiding in a tiny street.</p>

<p>Waaaaa!  I have been missing out.  The masala dosa here was shivering delicious - warm, crispy, spongy, and mouth-watering buttery.  For its reputation and quality, the price was surprisingly inexpensive.  Two coffees, a masala dosa, a portion of idli, and an onion dosa - all came out for under 250 rupees ($4.06).  We were so impressed that we returned the next morning.  This time each of us got our own masala dosa since this heavenly goodness is definitely not for sharing.  I finished mine in a heartbeat and salivated profusely watching the evil Adam slowly appreciating his last few bites. I did conspire to steal a bite of his by batting my eyelashes to distract him, but at the last minute, my conscience won.  Lucky Bunster!  Eat faster next time so you won&rsquo;t inadvertently torture poor poor Thien.</p>

<p>Now I can consider us redeemed.  And we can totally boast that we have eaten one of the tastiest masala dosas in the world.</p>

<p>Next stop:  Vaishali - Pune!  Watch out, masala dosa monster is coming!!! Rarrrr Rarrrr Nom Nom.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The 4-hour taxi ride, 20-hour flight time, and 8-hour waiting in between was all worth it when I spotted my sister&rsquo;s face at the international arrival waiting area. Her signature pick-Thien-up-and-twirl-Thien-around bear hug felt like being drifted in an endless stream of cascading flower petals - so nostalgic, cordial, and satisfying. I was so smug when Adam only got a normal bear hug - she loves him too but he was too heavy to be picked up, hah hah.</p>

<p>While we were gone, Papa and Mama helped us taking care of our house.  As if everything they do was not already more than enough, we came home to a spotless house and a finished garage - a surprise gift from Papa.  He had secretly re-taped and mudded all the drywall seams and gave the entire garage orange peel texture.  Of course we believed our eyes since we know how he expresses his care; but WOW!!! Oh how we are so loved and so spoiled&hellip;  Is it so wrong that I love every minute of it?</p>

<p>Only four days until Christmas and all I wanted to do was sleep.  Between the jetlag and both of us having a cold, I was not sure how we managed to do all the grocery shopping (4 different stores), host a family dinner, have a sleep over, buy and wrap gifts, and keep up the tradition of making eggnog and phở for Christmas Eve.  The readily available alcohol and the holiday fever certainly helped.</p>

<p>Christmas morning was no doubt my most anticipated time of the year.  We were all together, and some with a +1 or +2 this year.  No words could describe the blissful feeling when I was finally allowed to dive into my over-filled stocking and ferociously tear away the wrapper from Santa&rsquo;s gift.  Yes, as creepily grown up as we (the children) are, Santa still climbs down the chimney and brings presents in special Santa wrapper each year.  After drinking the eggnog saved for him in the fridge, he tipsily pets the bears, says Ho Ho Ho, and flies away in his sled.  Of course these information were volunteered in a jumble the next morning by the overly excited Misa, Bôn, Winter, and AirBob.</p>

<p>At the breakfast following the gifts opening, I stuffed my face with Mama&rsquo;s strawberry bread, bacon, cinnamon rolls, and my very own fried eggs (Mama knows that I don&rsquo;t like scrambled eggs so she always save 2 so I can fry them instead).  The Christmas dinner was the bomb with ham, Adam&rsquo;s special mac and cheese, roasted fennel with tomatoes, green bean amandine, baked corn, and sweet potato casserole.  As tradition dictates, I then napped through half of the last Hobbit movie at the theater.  The night ended after a few games of The Resistance in which Adam made me feel bad for being an exceptionally bad player in the role of a resistance.  When I dragged my zombie body to bed that night, I could not help but feel the overwhelming sadness that Christmas was over.  I would have to be away soon, leaving behind all the hugs, the laughter, and the crazy quirks of those whom I love most in this world.  I was for once glad of the exhaustion that prevented me from crying.</p>

<p>The rest of the break was a blur - scenes moving too fast to discern.  I met up with friends, had some more family time, cooked, drank, cleaned, and ate beef - lots lots lots of beef.  On the way to the airport, reality finally came back when mama told me of how my sister had cried after we said our goodbyes last night.  My heart shattered.</p>

<p>So after the 20-hour flight time, 4-hour taxi ride, and 8-hour waiting in between, here I am, back to India.  Hands and feet and nose are all accounted for, but I know that I&rsquo;m not whole - and probably won&rsquo;t be, for quite a while more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>By the time I made my way to the guesthouse&rsquo;s front porch, the owner, Sharmilla, was telling the rest of the group the bizarre story of how her dog survived an attack from a full grown leopard not long ago.  When I encountered him the next morning, I could still see the injuries around his neck.  He stood to my shoulder, and would be much taller than me if standing up on two legs.  For being capable of fighting off a leopard, he surprisingly seemed quiet and gentle.</p>

<p>Exhausted and sweaty from our day trip, Adam and I sneaked away for a shower when everyone else was still engulfed in Sharmilla&rsquo;s stories.  Since the shared bathroom did not have any hangers, we had to take turn holding each other&rsquo;s clothes while the other cringed convulsively under the icy cold water.  Now looking back, to have your already not-too-well-endowed body parts shrunk even further seems rather funny - a much better feeling than the agony I felt when the first ray of water hit my body.</p>

<p>Adam and I were ecstatic when a group member asked if we would like to have some liquor with the evening meal since a few others were in the mood for a little relaxant.  Of course we grinned like fools and nodded.  The cheap vodka mixed with fresh lime, sugar, and soda water tasted like heaven, especially when you got to share it with friends who do not normally drink.  I was feeling good when the light at the guesthouse&rsquo;s restaurant started to dim at around 10:00.  One minute I was lounging lazily against Adam then the next there were shouting for us to get out as fast as we can.  What the hell?  All I managed was a glimpse of a flashing light before getting shoved unceremoniously barefooted with the others toward the back of the restaurant.  My instant two cents: What about my shoes? Are we being arrested because other visitors are doing weeds?  The excitement didn&rsquo;t last long; we were let back into the restaurant after five minutes.  Turned out the police came to make sure that the restaurant closes down at 10:00.  How nuts!</p>

<p>Afterward, our group reconvened and voted to skip the sightseeing of some places two hours away from Hampi the next day. The morning was much more relaxing since we did not have a schedule except to leave at noon.  Many slept in because they stayed up late the night before, chatting and singing (this information came from the others since Adam and I shamelessly put our old bones to sleep at midnight).  A few rented motorbikes for a ride.  Priti and I ran into each other at the restaurant and decided for a walk along the fields. We later found our way to the top of the stacking stones overlooking our guesthouse.  I laughed my head off when she told me to pretend to sleep on a rock for a picture.</p>

<p>For <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/about-us">Thoughtworkers</a> Pune, no trips could be called successful until the battles to the death between the mafias and the villagers are settled.  If you think they are intense at work, you would shiver at the blood lust in their eyes when playing this <a href="http://ww2.kqed.org/pop/2013/12/17/how-to-play-mafia-an-in-depth-guide-to-the-perfect-holiday-game/">game</a>. On being assigned their roles, each automatically turns into a lion mixed with a fox - cunning, fierce, and just damn scary.  When these guys try to convince others that you are a mafia, you will feel like a piece of meat that is being chewed, then spit out, then played with, then chewed again.  Word of advice, if you have a weak heart but are gung-ho for the thrills, bring extra pants!  It&rsquo;s tricky business when sharing a ride with the mafia.  With that in mind, I quit after the forth game and curled into a sleeping ball the rest of the way home.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Modern day <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/241">Hampi</a> was once the last capital of the last great Hindu Kingdom of Vijayanagar (14th-16th Century). Before being conquered by the Deccan Muslim confederacy in 1565 and then later abandoned, the city with its marvelous temples and palaces flourished under the cotton and the spice trade.  Today, the 1600+ surviving structures make Hampi one of the most striking ruins in the world.</p>

<p>After about 300 selfies at the guesthouse&rsquo;s gate, we headed toward the Tungabhadra river and boarded a pink ferry to be taken accross.  I was climbing the steps above the riverbank, enjoying the soothing river breeze when my eyes bulged at the most entrancing and exotic sight:  a snake charmer.  Dressed in a white shirt and a white/blue lungi, the man sat cross-legged and nonchalantly played his pungi to his dancing snake.  My heart jumped out when I saw him reaching over to pet the creepy creature.  He kept trying to wave us closer but I didn&rsquo;t bring enough pants to risk wetting a pair.  As amazing as the experience was, I was relieved to know that the practice of snake charming has been declared unlawful - although it&rsquo;s still active in many rural parts of India.</p>

<p>While we were lost in the feverish frenzy of the snake charmer, our fellow friends had hired four rickshaws for the day.  With limited time, we only visited the most important monuments.  Most require entrance fees, which are significantly higher (about 25 times) for foreigners than Indian citizens or visitors of <a href="http://www.saarc-sec.org/SAARC-Charter/5/">SAARC</a> and <a href="http://www.mea.gov.in/Portal/ForeignRelation/BIMSTEC_Brief_February_2014.pdf">BIMSTEC</a>.  I can see the reason for such differences in price but I could not help but feeling wary.  Even so, the breathtaking and well-maintained structures quickly reconciled my uneasiness.  I regretted that we did not get to see everything; to absorbed these spectacles properly would take at least a week.</p>

<p>We returned to the riverbank just in time to catch the last ferry at around 6:00 p.m.  If we had missed it, we would cross in a <a href="http://hampi.in/coracle-crossings">coracle</a> (a gigantic floating basket) instead, which would have been quite an adventure.  Leaving behind the pink and orange sky at dusk, we once again crossed the empty burnt fields, unknowing of a few interesting events to come that evening.</p>
