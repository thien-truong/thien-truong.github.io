Crossing the stateline, everyone must put their name and age on a sign-up sheet to be given to the officers stationed on the highway. The constant potholes made it a rather painful ride when Adam and I sat at the back of the bus.  At one point when the front wheels made a sudden drop in elevation, we bounced up at least two feet in the air. I don&rsquo;t have any b&hellip;s but it still hurt like nuts (no pun intended).  On the plus side, we did get to try out some paans - mixture of ingredients including betel nut, herbs, spices and often tobacco, wrapped in a betel leaf - which were flavorful yet very uncomforting to the paan-virgin tongues.</p>

<p><figure class='caption-wrapper' style='width:px;'><img class='caption center' src='https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-9O101LujofY/VJFyX8sgq5I/AAAAAAAAFOg/DnzWhojXtuk/w1478-h1094-no/IMG_20141128_230322.jpg">https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-9O101LujofY/VJFyX8sgq5I/AAAAAAAAFOg/DnzWhojXtuk/w1478-h1094-no/IMG_20141128_230322.jpg</a>&#8217; width=&#8221; height=&#8221; title=&#8217;About to chew some swallowable paans after dinner&#8217;><figcaption class='caption-text'>About to chew some swallowable paans after dinner</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>We reached Hampi at around one thirty in the morning.  I could hear the branches scratching along the side of the bus when we entered the six-feet-wide, unlit and unpaved road that leads to the guesthouse.  With only the bus headlight to provide any visibility and no GPS (I&rsquo;m not even sure if GPS could help in this remote place), our driver missed a turn and drove into a road that unexpectedly narrowed to about only three feet wide.  Unable to reverse the bus in the jet-black night, we abandoned ship and walked to our guesthouse, <a href="http://thegoancorner.com/">the Goan Corner</a>, which thankfully was only 200 feet away.</p>

<p><figure class='caption-wrapper' style='width:px;'><img class='caption center' src='https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-t8nVOKRNEto/VJFyXu59iUI/AAAAAAAAFOM/RhKd5ZXkVtY/w1478-h1094-no/IMG_20141129_012317.jpg">https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-t8nVOKRNEto/VJFyXu59iUI/AAAAAAAAFOM/RhKd5ZXkVtY/w1478-h1094-no/IMG_20141129_012317.jpg</a>&#8217; width=&#8221; height=&#8221; title=&#8217;All attempts to back up were futile&#8217;><figcaption class='caption-text'>All attempts to back up were futile</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Turned out our group of fourteen only had 2 rooms reserved and only 2 persons were allowed in each room.  The rooms were actually separate thatch-roofed cots with hammocks on the joined porch. The team courteously gave Adam and I our own room; two other ladies had the other. The rest had to sleep on the uncovered rooftop with provided mosquito nets and thin mats. When I found out that they did not have enough blankets to keep warm, I felt like a spoiled human because we left the ceiling fan running for most of the night in our room.</p>

<p>I found myself awake at 7:00 in the morning despite not having much sleep both nights before. The refreshing air outside had a faint smell of burnt leaves.  The guesthouse caretaker used them to boil big tanks of water behind each shared bathroom, not that I saw a drop of hot water from the faucets during our time there. Apparently they will bring you a bucket of hot water if you ask.</p>

<p><figure class='caption-wrapper' style='width:px;'><img class='caption center' src='https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-nJADsZAQL3s/VJFyZL4HPqI/AAAAAAAAFOo/kDs6neprd48/w1478-h1094-no/IMG_20141129_073857.jpg">https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-nJADsZAQL3s/VJFyZL4HPqI/AAAAAAAAFOo/kDs6neprd48/w1478-h1094-no/IMG_20141129_073857.jpg</a>&#8217; width=&#8221; height=&#8221; title=&#8217;The abandoned bus&#8217;><figcaption class='caption-text'>The abandoned bus</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Ignoring the mundane facts that the power was cut off most of the time and one must bring his own toilet tissues, the place was absolutely exotic and mesmerizing. A topless young guy of about 18 (who roomed in the next cot) cheerfully greeted us from his front porch while rolling a joint.  He has been in Hampi for about a week and will stay for two months.  Most people who stays in this area&rsquo;s guesthouses are &ldquo;hippy backpackers&rdquo;.  Many do bouldering (a form of rock climbing that is performed without the use of ropes or harnesses) and carry around with them a mattress to ease their fall.  One even possesses a <a href="http://www.hang.ch/en/news/category/video">hang</a> and gifted us with a melody that could melt a soul.</p>

<p>Being on schedule for a big group was impossible and a nuisance.  I often refuse to sympathize and tend to get very impatient.  Luckily the unperturbed Bunster was there to remind me to breathe and just enjoy the spectacular view.  It was not until 11:00 that we finally headed out for some sightseeing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An Indian wedding usually spreads over a few days with different functions and rituals.  Although a <a href="http://www.culturalindia.net/weddings/regional-weddings/maharashtrian-wedding.html">Maharashtrian wedding</a> might be the simplest in the country, the list of ceremonies is still long and too complicated to describe.</p>

<p>As co-workers/friends, we were invited to attend the last day of the wedding.  Upon arriving, each of us received a tiny package of colorful rice grains.  At first I thought they were wedding favors; but later I found out that they were to be thrown upon the couple at a certain part of the ceremony.  Being as short as I am, all the rice landed on the poor guy&rsquo;s head in front of me (sorry, Shridhar).</p>

<p>Pooja was a graceful and beautiful bride.  When she and Saurabh made their entrance, all the young people (and some elderly people) surrounded them and started to burst out moves to the live band music.  The colors, the sounds, and the vibrancy were unbelievable.  The ceremony followed did not take long (I must admit that it was hard to pay attention when I could not understand most of what was going on).  I felt like a monkey, clap and throw rice and ooh-ahhh when everybody else did. Worked out well enough though.</p>

<p>Afterward our team presented the couple with our collective gift (a piece of gold), posed for pictures, then came out to the patio for the reception.  We must give big thanks to Shridhar for guiding us through all the confusion and giving disapproving looks to people who tried to cut in front of us.  While we fill up our hungry tummies, Pooja and her husband sat on the throne inside the ceremony room to accept more gifts and blessings.  How awesome is that?</p>

<p>It was spectacular to be able to witness the official joining of two souls. We were very thankful and honored to be included in such a beautiful and special event.</p>

<p>Live long and prosper, Pooja and Saurabh!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first Thanksgiving without families and turkey turned out to be just as amazing spending with friends immersing in Indian cultures and customs. Pooja, Adam&rsquo;s co-worker, was saying goodbye to her single life and we were very honored to be a part of it.</p>

<p>On Thursday night, we celebrated Gobble Gobble day with a hefty load of KFC.  Being the shameful last-minute packers that we are, we only had a three hours sleep before heading to Solapur. Thankfully, the Thoughtworkers team had made all the arrangements for the trip so we only have to drag our zombie bodies down to the front of our complex to meet the bus. We had insider information that it will be there at around 4:15, so we went down at 4:00.  Naturally, the happy thing didn&rsquo;t arrive until 5:00. An hour breathing the fresh morning air wasn&rsquo;t too bad, if not counting all the blood I lost to the dang mosquitoes.</p>

<p>On the way, we stopped for breakfast at a restaurant that has the most flies I have ever seen. But to be fair, the place was very clean and the food was decent.  Maybe the flies just like to sunbathe on the shiny metal tables.  Oh well, you have the right to live and enjoy life as any other creatures on this Earth, friend Flies! (Adam has been reading about Taoism and it&rsquo;s rubbing off on me)</p>

<p>After a five-hour ride, we arrived to a house that Pooja&rsquo;s family has rented for the guests to rest. From the 2nd floor balcony, I felt strangely peaceful watching a man pushing a fruit cart along the side of the field while the cows munching leisurely on some grass.  Below, some of the guys decided for a quick game of cricket in the small paved backyard before getting ready for the ceremony.  Adam and I opted to read instead, sweating profusely did not seem to be a fun start for a wedding.</p>
