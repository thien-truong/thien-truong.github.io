    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>By the time I made my way to the guesthouse&rsquo;s front porch, the owner, Sharmilla, was telling the rest of the group the bizarre story of how her dog survived an attack from a full grown leopard not long ago.  When I encountered him the next morning, I could still see the injuries around his neck.  He stood to my shoulder, and would be much taller than me if standing up on two legs.  For being capable of fighting off a leopard, he surprisingly seemed quiet and gentle.</p>

<p>Exhausted and sweaty from our day trip, Adam and I sneaked away for a shower when everyone else was still engulfed in Sharmilla&rsquo;s stories.  Since the shared bathroom did not have any hangers, we had to take turn holding each other&rsquo;s clothes while the other cringed convulsively under the icy cold water.  Now looking back, to have your already not-too-well-endowed body parts shrunk even further seems rather funny - a much better feeling than the agony I felt when the first ray of water hit my body.</p>

<p>Adam and I were ecstatic when a group member asked if we would like to have some liquor with the evening meal since a few others were in the mood for a little relaxant.  Of course we grinned like fools and nodded.  The cheap vodka mixed with fresh lime, sugar, and soda water tasted like heaven, especially when you got to share it with friends who do not normally drink.  I was feeling good when the light at the guesthouse&rsquo;s restaurant started to dim at around 10:00.  One minute I was lounging lazily against Adam then the next there were shouting for us to get out as fast as we can.  What the hell?  All I managed was a glimpse of a flashing light before getting shoved unceremoniously barefooted with the others toward the back of the restaurant.  My instant two cents: What about my shoes? Are we being arrested because other visitors are doing weeds?  The excitement didn&rsquo;t last long; we were let back into the restaurant after five minutes.  Turned out the police came to make sure that the restaurant closes down at 10:00.  How nuts!</p>

<p>Afterward, our group reconvened and voted to skip the sightseeing of some places two hours away from Hampi the next day. The morning was much more relaxing since we did not have a schedule except to leave at noon.  Many slept in because they stayed up late the night before, chatting and singing (this information came from the others since Adam and I shamelessly put our old bones to sleep at midnight).  A few rented motorbikes for a ride.  Priti and I ran into each other at the restaurant and decided for a walk along the fields. We later found our way to the top of the stacking stones overlooking our guesthouse.  I laughed my head off when she told me to pretend to sleep on a rock for a picture.</p>

<p>For <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/about-us">Thoughtworkers</a> Pune, no trips could be called successful until the battles to the death between the mafias and the villagers are settled.  If you think they are intense at work, you would shiver at the blood lust in their eyes when playing this <a href="http://ww2.kqed.org/pop/2013/12/17/how-to-play-mafia-an-in-depth-guide-to-the-perfect-holiday-game/">game</a>. On being assigned their roles, each automatically turns into a lion mixed with a fox - cunning, fierce, and just damn scary.  When these guys try to convince others that you are a mafia, you will feel like a piece of meat that is being chewed, then spit out, then played with, then chewed again.  Word of advice, if you have a weak heart but are gung-ho for the thrills, bring extra pants!  It&rsquo;s tricky business when sharing a ride with the mafia.  With that in mind, I quit after the forth game and curled into a sleeping ball the rest of the way home.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Hampi - Remnants of the Past]]></title>
    <link href="http://thienscribbles.com/blog/2014/12/18/hampi/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-18T11:07:27+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://thienscribbles.com/blog/2014/12/18/hampi</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Modern day <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/241">Hampi</a> was once the last capital of the last great Hindu Kingdom of Vijayanagar (14th-16th Century). Before being conquered by the Deccan Muslim confederacy in 1565 and then later abandoned, the city with its marvelous temples and palaces flourished under the cotton and the spice trade.  Today, the 1600+ surviving structures make Hampi one of the most striking ruins in the world.</p>

<p>After about 300 selfies at the guesthouse&rsquo;s gate, we headed toward the Tungabhadra river and boarded a pink ferry to be taken accross.  I was climbing the steps above the riverbank, enjoying the soothing river breeze when my eyes bulged at the most entrancing and exotic sight:  a snake charmer.  Dressed in a white shirt and a white/blue lungi, the man sat cross-legged and nonchalantly played his pungi to his dancing snake.  My heart jumped out when I saw him reaching over to pet the creepy creature.  He kept trying to wave us closer but I didn&rsquo;t bring enough pants to risk wetting a pair.  As amazing as the experience was, I was relieved to know that the practice of snake charming has been declared unlawful - although it&rsquo;s still active in many rural parts of India.</p>

<p>While we were lost in the feverish frenzy of the snake charmer, our fellow friends had hired four rickshaws for the day.  With limited time, we only visited the most important monuments.  Most require entrance fees, which are significantly higher (about 25 times) for foreigners than Indian citizens or visitors of <a href="http://www.saarc-sec.org/SAARC-Charter/5/">SAARC</a> and <a href="http://www.mea.gov.in/Portal/ForeignRelation/BIMSTEC_Brief_February_2014.pdf">BIMSTEC</a>.  I can see the reason for such differences in price but I could not help but feeling wary.  Even so, the breathtaking and well-maintained structures quickly reconciled my uneasiness.  I regretted that we did not get to see everything; to absorbed these spectacles properly would take at least a week.</p>

<p>We returned to the riverbank just in time to catch the last ferry at around 6:00 p.m.  If we had missed it, we would cross in a <a href="http://hampi.in/coracle-crossings">coracle</a> (a gigantic floating basket) instead, which would have been quite an adventure.  Leaving behind the pink and orange sky at dusk, we once again crossed the empty burnt fields, unknowing of a few interesting events to come that evening.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Leaving <a href="http://thien-truong.github.io/blog/2014/12/15/a-maharashtrian-wedding-the-ceremony-and-reception/">Pooja&rsquo;s wedding</a> from Solapur, we headed south to Hampi, a village in the Karnataka state.  Crossing the stateline, everyone must put their name and age on a sign-up sheet to be given to the officers stationed on the highway. The constant potholes made it a rather painful ride when Adam and I sat at the back of the bus.  At one point when the front wheels made a sudden drop in elevation, we bounced up at least two feet in the air. I don&rsquo;t have any b&hellip;s but it still hurt like nuts (no pun intended).  On the plus side, we did get to try out some paans - mixture of ingredients including betel nut, herbs, spices and often tobacco, wrapped in a betel leaf - which were flavorful yet very uncomforting to the paan-virgin tongues.</p>

<p>We reached Hampi at around one thirty in the morning.  I could hear the branches scratching along the side of the bus when we entered the six-feet-wide, unlit and unpaved road that leads to the guesthouse.  With only the bus headlight to provide any visibility and no GPS (I&rsquo;m not even sure if GPS could help in this remote place), our driver missed a turn and drove into a road that unexpectedly narrowed to about only three feet wide.  Unable to reverse the bus in the jet-black night, we abandoned ship and walked to our guesthouse, <a href="http://thegoancorner.com/">the Goan Corner</a>, which thankfully was only 200 feet away.</p>

<p><figure class='caption-wrapper' style='width:px;'><img class='caption center' src='https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-t8nVOKRNEto/VJFyXu59iUI/AAAAAAAAFOM/RhKd5ZXkVtY/w1478-h1094-no/IMG_20141129_012317.jpg">https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-t8nVOKRNEto/VJFyXu59iUI/AAAAAAAAFOM/RhKd5ZXkVtY/w1478-h1094-no/IMG_20141129_012317.jpg</a>&#8217; width=&#8221; height=&#8221; title=&#8217;All attempts to back up were futile&#8217;><figcaption class='caption-text'>All attempts to back up were futile</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Turned out our group of fourteen only had 2 rooms reserved and only 2 persons were allowed in each room.  The rooms were actually separate thatch-roofed cots with hammocks on the joined porch. The team courteously gave Adam and I our own room; two other ladies had the other. The rest had to sleep on the uncovered rooftop with provided mosquito nets and thin mats. When I found out that they did not have enough blankets to keep warm, I felt like a spoiled human because we left the ceiling fan running for most of the night in our room.</p>

<p>I found myself awake at 7:00 in the morning despite not having much sleep both nights before. The refreshing air outside had a faint smell of burnt leaves.  The guesthouse caretaker used them to boil big tanks of water behind each shared bathroom, not that I saw a drop of hot water from the faucets during our time there. Apparently they will bring you a bucket of hot water if you ask.</p>

<p>Ignoring the mundane facts that the power was cut off most of the time and one must bring his own toilet tissues, the place was absolutely exotic and mesmerizing. A topless young guy of about 18 (who roomed in the next cot) cheerfully greeted us from his front porch while rolling a joint.  He has been in Hampi for about a week and will stay for two months.  Most people who stays in this area&rsquo;s guesthouses are &ldquo;hippy backpackers&rdquo;.  Many do bouldering (a form of rock climbing that is performed without the use of ropes or harnesses) and carry around with them a mattress to ease their fall.  One even possesses a <a href="http://www.hang.ch/en/news/category/video">hang</a> and gifted us with a melody that could melt a soul.</p>

<p>Being on schedule for a big group was impossible and a nuisance.  I often refuse to sympathize and tend to get very impatient.  Luckily the unperturbed Bunster was there to remind me to breathe and just enjoy the spectacular view.  It was not until 11:00 that we finally headed out for some sightseeing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An Indian wedding usually spreads over a few days with different functions and rituals.  Although a <a href="http://www.culturalindia.net/weddings/regional-weddings/maharashtrian-wedding.html">Maharashtrian wedding</a> might be the simplest in the country, the list of ceremonies is still long and too complicated to describe.</p>

<p>As co-workers/friends, we were invited to attend the last day of the wedding.  Upon arriving, each of us received a tiny package of colorful rice grains.  At first I thought they were wedding favors; but later I found out that they were to be thrown upon the couple at a certain part of the ceremony.  Being as short as I am, all the rice landed on the poor guy&rsquo;s head in front of me (sorry, Shridhar).</p>

<p>Pooja was a graceful and beautiful bride.  When she and Saurabh made their entrance, all the young people (and some elderly people) surrounded them and started to burst out moves to the live band music.  The colors, the sounds, and the vibrancy were unbelievable.  The ceremony followed did not take long (I must admit that it was hard to pay attention when I could not understand most of what was going on).  I felt like a monkey, clap and throw rice and ooh-ahhh when everybody else did. Worked out well enough though.</p>

<p>Afterward our team presented the couple with our collective gift (a piece of gold), posed for pictures, then came out to the patio for the reception.  We must give big thanks to Shridhar for guiding us through all the confusion and giving disapproving looks to people who tried to cut in front of us.  While we fill up our hungry tummies, Pooja and her husband sat on the throne inside the ceremony room to accept more gifts and blessings.  How awesome is that?</p>

<p>It was spectacular to be able to witness the official joining of two souls. We were very thankful and honored to be included in such a beautiful and special event.</p>

<p>Live long and prosper, Pooja and Saurabh!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first Thanksgiving without families and turkey turned out to be just as amazing spending with friends immersing in Indian cultures and customs. Pooja, Adam&rsquo;s co-worker, was saying goodbye to her single life and we were very honored to be a part of it.</p>

<p>On Thursday night, we celebrated Gobble Gobble day with a hefty load of KFC.  Being the shameful last-minute packers that we are, we only had a three hours sleep before heading to Solapur. Thankfully, the Thoughtworkers team had made all the arrangements for the trip so we only have to drag our zombie bodies down to the front of our complex to meet the bus. We had insider information that it will be there at around 4:15, so we went down at 4:00.  Naturally, the happy thing didn&rsquo;t arrive until 5:00. An hour breathing the fresh morning air wasn&rsquo;t too bad, if not counting all the blood I lost to the dang mosquitoes.</p>

<p>On the way, we stopped for breakfast at a restaurant that has the most flies I have ever seen. But to be fair, the place was very clean and the food was decent.  Maybe the flies just like to sunbathe on the shiny metal tables.  Oh well, you have the right to live and enjoy life as any other creatures on this Earth, friend Flies! (Adam has been reading about Taoism and it&rsquo;s rubbing off on me)</p>

<p>After a five-hour ride, we arrived to a house that Pooja&rsquo;s family has rented for the guests to rest. From the 2nd floor balcony, I felt strangely peaceful watching a man pushing a fruit cart along the side of the field while the cows munching leisurely on some grass.  Below, some of the guys decided for a quick game of cricket in the small paved backyard before getting ready for the ceremony.  Adam and I opted to read instead, sweating profusely did not seem to be a fun start for a wedding.</p>
