    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>2.5 months in India.</li>
<li>Had a blast attending an Indian wedding in Solapur and hanging out with friends/co-workers in scenic Hampi last weekend.</li>
<li>The weather has been extremely pleasant; I cannot say I miss the winter in the U.S.</li>
<li>Adam got a fever last night. Poor the fur ball, too much play and not enough sleep.</li>
<li>The planning for Nepal trip in Feb is 95% done.  Tickets booked, hotels/guest houses reserved.  Only thing left is to confirm guide and porter for trekking trip.</li>
<li>Two more weeks until we fly home for the break.  Way behind on Christmas shopping.</li>
<li>Breakfast and lunch are much more comforting now that the food vendors are changed in the cafeteria.  I kept finding hairs in my food with the old ones.  Haizz&hellip; and sometimes I don&rsquo;t think they were hairs from the head.</li>
<li>Favorite Indian starter:  chicken lollipop. Succulent flavorful heaven.</li>
<li>I know I&rsquo;m spoiled when I cannot do business in a swat toilet.  I even sang to coax myself but it didn&rsquo;t work.  Bahhh.</li>
<li>Always bring toilet paper when traveling in India.</li>
<li>I told Adam that it would be cloudy all the time we were in Solapur and Hampi. The result?  He got some serious sunburn.  The lesson? Don&rsquo;t trust Thien to look up the weather.</li>
<li>Cutest Indian saying: &ldquo;click&rdquo;.  They use the word &ldquo;click&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;take picture&rdquo;.  Such as:  &ldquo;Will you click me?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Nice clickworks!&rdquo;</li>
<li>Big banana:  5 rupees each.  Tiny banana:  5 rupees each.  What??? How could that be when they taste equally good? Oh well, bigger is better.</li>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t seen my guava man for almost a week.  I&rsquo;m worried and sad.  But that did not stop me from having an affair with another guava man who sells red-flesh guavas.  I mean, even Bunster does not blame me.</li>
<li>I must confess my shame to maah spoony sister:  I eat McDonald!!!! And I like it.  The McSpicy is so good here.</li>
<li>I think I&rsquo;m starting to like India.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://thienscribbles.com/blog/2014/11/02/lovely-november/"/>
    <updated>2014-11-02T20:09:29+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://thienscribbles.com/blog/2014/11/02/lovely-november</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>November has always been my favorite month of the year.  The air seems sweeter, the sky bluer, and the sun more warm and radiant.  November is the time for pumpkin beer, pumpkin pie, pumpkin and oxtail cous cous, pumpkin ginger bread pudding, Starbucks pumpkin spice latte, pumpkin pancakes (for Adam, Thien eats banana blueberry pancakes), Thanksgiving, first batch of homemade eggnog, and Christmas tree decoration (at Mama&rsquo;s).</p>

<p>If I were in Texas, Adam and papa Fred would make a fire about this time.  Papasito has this awesome fire pit made from an end of a huge propane tank (it has made the list to be the family heirloom). Then we would roast the last of the habaneros and jalapenos from the garden with bacon and cream cheese. The sizzling sound of the bacon fat dripping on the scorching wood usually drives us frenzy.  After gobbling down a whole stuffed habanero in one shot, gung-ho Adam and Rebecca would have to flap their tongues like some nuts while smokes seeping out the their ears (Thien does not de-seed completely, hee hee).  Oh well, since those two would be a little handicapped after that brave episode, more yummies for evil Thien!</p>

<p>November in India does not come with the turning of the leaves but the gorgeous weather brings much comfort to my nostalgia.  Today I woke up at 2:00p.m hungry like a bear.  Adam fed me some chicken momos (dumplings) with hot sauce then we ventured out for some more snacks. It felt so good to be walking under the warm sunlight, observing all the happiness around.  Happy Thien wants to give everybody bear hugs, with drools and paws and everything.  Since I didn&rsquo;t really dare to hug anybody, I took lots of pictures instead.  Of course the Bunster sang the &ldquo;Thien took wayyyyyy too many pictures&rdquo; song, but he&rsquo;ll be thankful when he is creepily old and his memory is dimmed.  Thien will remind you of the good old days, Bunster&hellip; with kick-ass illustrations too!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I want to curl into a ball and roll around.  But I can&rsquo;t since my bed is too small and the floor is too hard (and roaches run on it sometimes too). How I wish for some oxtails to gnaw on right now.  This meatless land is making me weak and restless. My teeth are itchy.  I have becoming increasingly bite-ty.  Maybe in another month, even BoBeQue (hehehe) will start to sound good.  Num num.  Nom nom.</p>

<p>So I and the Bunster have decided to make a trip to Nepal the first week of February.  I&rsquo;ve been planning nonstop for the past week.  Now when I close my eyes, all I see are travel search engines and currency converters. The cranky Bunster is excited to go but does not want to hear about any of the planning.  Oh well, don&rsquo;t complain when Thien leads you to a place that serves mountain oyster and tell you that it&rsquo;s fried cheese stick. Hah!  Num num.  Nom nom.</p>

<p>I will go chant Pancakes and be happy!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Time flies.  Too fast for my own good.</p>

<p>India has been a treat, but it has also been a burden.  Some days I wake up feeling invincible, like nothing could stop me from having all the fun in the world.  I dress up pretty, parade happily on the streets, smile and wave at familiar faces (sometimes I wave at strangers by mistakes too), and chip chirp until Adam&rsquo;s ears fall off.  Some days I just want to claw somebody&rsquo;s face out thinking of mundane things such as will we have dial up speed for the Internet, will I be able to find this location that is clearly marked on Google Map (much harder to find in real life), will a beggar child jab at me today while others stare to see if I would part with any rupees, is my family in danger of Ebola at home, do we have enough change for a snack and a rickshaw ride&hellip;</p>

<p>I love the feeling of being able to walk to many places.  Children play loudly in the yard everyday. They run, and scream, and dance.  Street food are inexpensive yet delicious.  Many seem to be healthy; I rarely ever see a chubby person let alone any obesity.  Women and men love to wear traditional clothes.  Everybody is festive.  Dogs walk around unafraid to be eaten.  There are always beautiful exotic tropical flowers on the streets.  Fruits and vegetables are fresh and full of flavor.</p>

<p>I feel guilty that I don&rsquo;t dare walking through a slum for fearing that I could be harmed in some way.  I do not know Hindi and I don&rsquo;t even attempt to learn any.  I am guilty for being disappointing when a person here does not speak English (which is most of them). I neglect washing the dishes some day because I know housekeeping will do it. I would not give money to beggars but eat expensive meal sometimes.</p>

<p>I hate to always have my backpack checked and tied up (so I couldn&rsquo;t steal anything) when entering a mall, a bank, a convenient store, a grocery store&hellip;  The Internet is too slow and unsteady.  Not many people smile, nobody hugs.  Some locals feel just to charge me more because I&rsquo;m a foreigner.  Any paper works is a nightmare.  Some people appear to be malnourished and overworked.  Beef, pork, and tofu are hard to find, almost non-existent.  Garlics are tiny (very painful to peel).</p>

<p>But all in all, the goods are really good and the bads are really not that bad.  And learning to embrace cultural and life-style differences are challenges I gladly accept as many times as I&rsquo;m given the chance.</p>

<p>I will love you India - in time!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After what seemed to be forever, Adam finally got his visa last week and now is on his twenty-hours flight to Mumbai.  His company will send a person with a sign that says &ldquo;Mr. Russell&rdquo; at the airport and take him to his apartment in Pune.  I was relieved to know that he will not have to try to find a cab at 4 in the morning.</p>
