    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, I permanently take off the tiger tooth pendant that I have been wearing almost every day for the past eleven years.</p>

<p>A few hours ago, I was reading an <a href="http://ingenira.hubpages.com/hub/A-Teary-Mother-Bear-Killed-Her-Baby-and-Committed-Suicide-A-Heart-Breaking-True-Story">article</a> about the practice of bear bile farming and was enraged and revolted by the degree of cruelty that human are capable of.  But then it hit me: I&rsquo;m not any better.</p>

<p>All these years I repeatedly told myself that my tiger tooth probably came from a dead tiger from a zoo. Sadly, chances were that he suffered an abusive life and a painful death.  Regardless, I should have never wanted the tooth in the first place.</p>

<p>What a selfish and ignorant monster I am! I paid $50 for a tooth but it might have cost a tiger his life. He did no harms to me, yet I killed him.  My pendant was once my pride, but now it&rsquo;s my shame.  My cruelty is the reason animals are still being violated and murdered.</p>

<p>Please help by telling the likes of me to STOP, NOW!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very sorry, Tiger!</p>
