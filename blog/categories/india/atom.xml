    <id>http://thienscribbles.com/blog/2015/01/26/happy-republic-day</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today marks India&rsquo;s 66th Republic Day - a commemoration of when India&rsquo;s Constitution came into effect on January 26th, 1950.  Each year, the Indian government invites a different foreign head of state to be its special guest.  This year, as the result of an unprecedented invitation from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the honorary goes to President Obama.  He is the first sitting U.S. President to be Chief Guest at the celebration parades in New Delhi.</p>

<p>Equally important, the theme for this year&rsquo;s parade is &ldquo;Nari Shakti&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Woman Power.&rdquo;  According to the <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2015/01/23/this-is-what-you-need-to-do-to-watch-the-republic-day-parade-with-obama/">Wall Street Journal</a>, &ldquo;while women have participated in the marching contingents before, this is the first time entire contingents from the cadres of the three armed forces (the Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force) will take the eight-kilometer long parade.&rdquo;  Hopefully, these brave and inspiring women will soon get larger roles in the forces and be allowed into combat fields.</p>

<p>At our apartment complex, the music has been playing very loudly through an amplifier since around 9:30 a.m. There is also an organized gettogether where all the kids participate in various games. From the 9th floor, I can hear every pitch of their happy screams - which are both refreshing and brain-scrambling. If past holiday experiences are any indication, this will go on until around 10 in the evening. For the people who are not accustomed to these prolonged noise exposures, you will feel quite abused.</p>

<p>Oh well, when in India, enjoy the music eh???  Happy Republic Day!</p>

    <link href="http://thienscribbles.com/blog/2015/01/25/the-unyielding-flower-heads-at-the-k-dot-r-market/"/>

    <id>http://thienscribbles.com/blog/2015/01/25/the-unyielding-flower-heads-at-the-k-dot-r-market</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During our break back home in December, we had to regretfully tell our food-lover friend Alan that we had not been to any open markets yet.   He didn’t give us bullet eyes, but we secretly felt shameful.   How could we stay in India for 3 months and not take our lazy bones out to an open market? Thus when we planned for our trip to Bangalore, we knew we must visit Krishna Rajendra Market – the biggest market in the city.</p>

<p>This market is usually busiest in the early morning; but by the time we got there at noon, the crowdedness did not seem to subside much.  We walked around aimlessly, almost suffocating with the vibrancy and aliveness.  A myriad of tiny shops fill both sides of the many narrow streets leading to the market center. Countless people invade the street pavements to sell fruits, vegetables, flowers, clothes, snacks, and almost everything imaginable.</p>

<p>At the center is a large complex with a glorious flower market on the underground level.  Since the people of India seem to favor garlands more than whole flower stems, heaps of flower heads are piled on the grounds, in baskets, and on low concrete stands. As I walked by, a gentleman charmingly offered me a rose head.  I wore it in my hair the whole day.</p>

<p>Our excitement and curiosity were undoubtedly visible. I was really glad that no one seemed to be bothered when I took pictures of their merchandise.  Actually, everybody was rather friendly.  As we stopped to study the many unfamiliar items at various vendors, quite a few people asked where we were from.  A fruit seller cut up a water apple for us to try even though we told him that we didn’t want to buy after inquiring about the price.  A man who sells dry goods waved me over and put a mark of red turmeric powder (a kumkuma) on my forehead.  He said gently:  “for Indian women.”</p>

<p>The kindness of his words however comforting was making me uneasy.  Sure, I was wearing a kurta&hellip; I might even pass as an Indian woman for a day, but I’m still just a stranger.  I saw the hustle bustle, the colors, the chaos; and I was amused.  I enjoyed the stroll knowing that I didn’t have to live it the next day or the day after.</p>

<p>This market is the only mean to make a living for many, but what a torment! Amidst the raw beauty lay the stench, the pollution, the lack of drainage systems, the overpopulation, and the lack of governmental support.  People lead hard lives here.  I came and I went.  Where can they go?  How long can these stemless flowers survive?</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[The Dosa Redemption]]></title>
    <link href="http://thienscribbles.com/blog/2015/01/21/the-dosa-redemption/"/>
    <updated>2015-01-21T12:26:37+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://thienscribbles.com/blog/2015/01/21/the-dosa-redemption</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dosa is a savory pancake made from a rice and black lentils batter and usually eaten with sambhar (lentil based vegetable stew) or chutney.  There are many types of <a href="http://food.ndtv.com/lists/indian-fast-food-top-10-dosa-recipes-694722">dosa</a>, but the most famous of them all might be the masala dosa: a dosa with sautéed potato and onion filling.</p>

<p>Before coming to India, I had a dream: to eat enough dosa to last me a lifetime since where else can I find better dosa than at its birthplace.  Thus naturally I ordered a cheese paper masala dosa for my first meal in Pune. What a sight it was when the waiter brought out the crêpe-like monster, so big it stretched across two dinner plates.  I tore out a piece of dosa, scooped up some potato filling, dipped it in the sambhar, put it in my mouth, and expected heaven.  Nom nom&hellip; waiting&hellip; Ehhhh, hmnn.  Nothing? Let&rsquo;s try again&hellip; Nom nom&hellip; Ehhh, hmnn&hellip; Something was not quite right here.  Where were the starburst and the mind-numbing bliss?  Why are people raving about this dish?</p>

<p><figure class='caption-wrapper' style='width:px;'><img class='caption center' src='https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-srEVBEpgKAs/VL9ZOPvjEtI/AAAAAAAAFf0/V8t4VNU8DXY/w820-h1094-no/IMG_9954.jpg">https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-srEVBEpgKAs/VL9ZOPvjEtI/AAAAAAAAFf0/V8t4VNU8DXY/w820-h1094-no/IMG_9954.jpg</a>&#8217; width=&#8221; height=&#8221; title=&#8217;The unimpressive (flavor-wise) first dosa experience at Kalyani Veg&#8217;><figcaption class='caption-text'>The unimpressive (flavor-wise) first dosa experience at Kalyani Veg</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Well, shame on me for not doing a more thorough research for better dosa places and for giving up after just one try.  I paid the price with three dosa-less months.  Thankfully, Adam and I were saved by our weekend getaway to Bangalore.</p>

<p>While searching for a restaurant specialized in Southern Indian cuisine for dinner, Adam came across <a href="http://www.mavallitiffinrooms.com/about-us/">MTR</a> - a beloved jewel of Bangalore eateries.  The foods they serve are intended for light meals so we decided to go there for breakfast the next morning.  The quest to find this place took so much patience because I insisted to walk from our hotel instead of taking a rickshaw.  We found the street it&rsquo;s supposed to be on but pinpointing the exact location was next to impossible.  After 45 minutes of wandering around and asking 5 different people, we finally found it hiding in a tiny street.</p>

<p>Waaaaa!  I have been missing out.  The masala dosa here was shivering delicious - warm, crispy, spongy, and mouth-watering buttery.  For its reputation and quality, the price was surprisingly inexpensive.  Two coffees, a masala dosa, a portion of idli, and an onion dosa - all came out for under 250 rupees ($4.06).  We were so impressed that we returned the next morning.  This time each of us got our own masala dosa since this heavenly goodness is definitely not for sharing.  I finished mine in a heartbeat and salivated profusely watching the evil Adam slowly appreciating his last few bites. I did conspire to steal a bite of his by batting my eyelashes to distract him, but at the last minute, my conscience won.  Lucky Bunster!  Eat faster next time so you won&rsquo;t inadvertently torture poor poor Thien.</p>

<p>Now I can consider us redeemed.  And we can totally boast that we have eaten one of the tastiest masala dosas in the world.</p>

<p>Next stop:  Vaishali - Pune!  Watch out, masala dosa monster is coming!!! Rarrrr Rarrrr Nom Nom.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>By the time I made my way to the guesthouse&rsquo;s front porch, the owner, Sharmilla, was telling the rest of the group the bizarre story of how her dog survived an attack from a full grown leopard not long ago.  When I encountered him the next morning, I could still see the injuries around his neck.  He stood to my shoulder, and would be much taller than me if standing up on two legs.  For being capable of fighting off a leopard, he surprisingly seemed quiet and gentle.</p>

<p>Exhausted and sweaty from our day trip, Adam and I sneaked away for a shower when everyone else was still engulfed in Sharmilla&rsquo;s stories.  Since the shared bathroom did not have any hangers, we had to take turn holding each other&rsquo;s clothes while the other cringed convulsively under the icy cold water.  Now looking back, to have your already not-too-well-endowed body parts shrunk even further seems rather funny - a much better feeling than the agony I felt when the first ray of water hit my body.</p>

<p>Adam and I were ecstatic when a group member asked if we would like to have some liquor with the evening meal since a few others were in the mood for a little relaxant.  Of course we grinned like fools and nodded.  The cheap vodka mixed with fresh lime, sugar, and soda water tasted like heaven, especially when you got to share it with friends who do not normally drink.  I was feeling good when the light at the guesthouse&rsquo;s restaurant started to dim at around 10:00.  One minute I was lounging lazily against Adam then the next there were shouting for us to get out as fast as we can.  What the hell?  All I managed was a glimpse of a flashing light before getting shoved unceremoniously barefooted with the others toward the back of the restaurant.  My instant two cents: What about my shoes? Are we being arrested because other visitors are doing weeds?  The excitement didn&rsquo;t last long; we were let back into the restaurant after five minutes.  Turned out the police came to make sure that the restaurant closes down at 10:00.  How nuts!</p>

<p>Afterward, our group reconvened and voted to skip the sightseeing of some places two hours away from Hampi the next day. The morning was much more relaxing since we did not have a schedule except to leave at noon.  Many slept in because they stayed up late the night before, chatting and singing (this information came from the others since Adam and I shamelessly put our old bones to sleep at midnight).  A few rented motorbikes for a ride.  Priti and I ran into each other at the restaurant and decided for a walk along the fields. We later found our way to the top of the stacking stones overlooking our guesthouse.  I laughed my head off when she told me to pretend to sleep on a rock for a picture.</p>

<p>For <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/about-us">Thoughtworkers</a> Pune, no trips could be called successful until the battles to the death between the mafias and the villagers are settled.  If you think they are intense at work, you would shiver at the blood lust in their eyes when playing this <a href="http://ww2.kqed.org/pop/2013/12/17/how-to-play-mafia-an-in-depth-guide-to-the-perfect-holiday-game/">game</a>. On being assigned their roles, each automatically turns into a lion mixed with a fox - cunning, fierce, and just damn scary.  When these guys try to convince others that you are a mafia, you will feel like a piece of meat that is being chewed, then spit out, then played with, then chewed again.  Word of advice, if you have a weak heart but are gung-ho for the thrills, bring extra pants!  It&rsquo;s tricky business when sharing a ride with the mafia.  With that in mind, I quit after the forth game and curled into a sleeping ball the rest of the way home.</p>
