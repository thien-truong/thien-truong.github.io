Crossing the stateline, everyone must put their name and age on a sign-up sheet to be given to the officers stationed on the highway. The constant potholes made it a rather painful ride when Adam and I sat at the back of the bus.  At one point when the front wheels made a sudden drop in elevation, we bounced up at least two feet in the air. I don&rsquo;t have any b&hellip;s but it still hurt like nuts (no pun intended).  On the plus side, we did get to try out some paans - mixture of ingredients including betel nut, herbs, spices and often tobacco, wrapped in a betel leaf - which were flavorful yet very uncomforting to the paan-virgin tongues.</p>

<p><figure class='caption-wrapper' style='width:px;'><img class='caption center' src='https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-9O101LujofY/VJFyX8sgq5I/AAAAAAAAFOg/DnzWhojXtuk/w1478-h1094-no/IMG_20141128_230322.jpg">https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-9O101LujofY/VJFyX8sgq5I/AAAAAAAAFOg/DnzWhojXtuk/w1478-h1094-no/IMG_20141128_230322.jpg</a>&#8217; width=&#8221; height=&#8221; title=&#8217;About to chew some swallowable paans after dinner&#8217;><figcaption class='caption-text'>About to chew some swallowable paans after dinner</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>We reached Hampi at around one thirty in the morning.  I could hear the branches scratching along the side of the bus when we entered the six-feet-wide, unlit and unpaved road that leads to the guesthouse.  With only the bus headlight to provide any visibility and no GPS (I&rsquo;m not even sure if GPS could help in this remote place), our driver missed a turn and drove into a road that unexpectedly narrowed to about only three feet wide.  Unable to reverse the bus in the jet-black night, we abandoned ship and walked to our guesthouse, <a href="http://thegoancorner.com/">the Goan Corner</a>, which thankfully was only 200 feet away.</p>

<p><figure class='caption-wrapper' style='width:px;'><img class='caption center' src='https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-t8nVOKRNEto/VJFyXu59iUI/AAAAAAAAFOM/RhKd5ZXkVtY/w1478-h1094-no/IMG_20141129_012317.jpg">https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-t8nVOKRNEto/VJFyXu59iUI/AAAAAAAAFOM/RhKd5ZXkVtY/w1478-h1094-no/IMG_20141129_012317.jpg</a>&#8217; width=&#8221; height=&#8221; title=&#8217;All attempts to back up were futile&#8217;><figcaption class='caption-text'>All attempts to back up were futile</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Turned out our group of fourteen only had 2 rooms reserved and only 2 persons were allowed in each room.  The rooms were actually separate thatch-roofed cots with hammocks on the joined porch. The team courteously gave Adam and I our own room; two other ladies had the other. The rest had to sleep on the uncovered rooftop with provided mosquito nets and thin mats. When I found out that they did not have enough blankets to keep warm, I felt like a spoiled human because we left the ceiling fan running for most of the night in our room.</p>

<p>I found myself awake at 7:00 in the morning despite not having much sleep both nights before. The refreshing air outside had a faint smell of burnt leaves.  The guesthouse caretaker used them to boil big tanks of water behind each shared bathroom, not that I saw a drop of hot water from the faucets during our time there. Apparently they will bring you a bucket of hot water if you ask.</p>

<p><figure class='caption-wrapper' style='width:px;'><img class='caption center' src='https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-nJADsZAQL3s/VJFyZL4HPqI/AAAAAAAAFOo/kDs6neprd48/w1478-h1094-no/IMG_20141129_073857.jpg">https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-nJADsZAQL3s/VJFyZL4HPqI/AAAAAAAAFOo/kDs6neprd48/w1478-h1094-no/IMG_20141129_073857.jpg</a>&#8217; width=&#8221; height=&#8221; title=&#8217;The abandoned bus&#8217;><figcaption class='caption-text'>The abandoned bus</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Ignoring the mundane facts that the power was cut off most of the time and one must bring his own toilet tissues, the place was absolutely exotic and mesmerizing. A topless young guy of about 18 (who roomed in the next cot) cheerfully greeted us from his front porch while rolling a joint.  He has been in Hampi for about a week and will stay for two months.  Most people who stays in this area&rsquo;s guesthouses are &ldquo;hippy backpackers&rdquo;.  Many do bouldering (a form of rock climbing that is performed without the use of ropes or harnesses) and carry around with them a mattress to ease their fall.  One even possesses a <a href="http://www.hang.ch/en/news/category/video">hang</a> and gifted us with a melody that could melt a soul.</p>

<p><figure class='caption-wrapper' style='width:px;'><img class='caption center' src='https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-7exkseLaI5U/VJFyZnpuDzI/AAAAAAAAFOw/krtJwNAzmQk/w1478-h1094-no/IMG_20141129_073907.jpg">https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-7exkseLaI5U/VJFyZnpuDzI/AAAAAAAAFOw/krtJwNAzmQk/w1478-h1094-no/IMG_20141129_073907.jpg</a>&#8217; width=&#8221; height=&#8221; title=&#8217;First look, Hampi&#8217;><figcaption class='caption-text'>First look, Hampi</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Being on schedule for a big group was impossible and a nuisance.  I often refuse to sympathize and tend to get very impatient.  Luckily the unperturbed Bunster was there to remind me to breathe and just enjoy the spectacular view.  It was not until 11:00 that we finally headed out for some sightseeing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An Indian wedding usually spreads over a few days with different functions and rituals.  Although a <a href="http://www.culturalindia.net/weddings/regional-weddings/maharashtrian-wedding.html">Maharashtrian wedding</a> might be the simplest in the country, the list of ceremonies is still long and too complicated to describe.</p>

<p>As co-workers/friends, we were invited to attend the last day of the wedding.  Upon arriving, each of us received a tiny package of colorful rice grains.  At first I thought they were wedding favors; but later I found out that they were to be thrown upon the couple at a certain part of the ceremony.  Being as short as I am, all the rice landed on the poor guy&rsquo;s head in front of me (sorry, Shridhar).</p>

<p>Pooja was a graceful and beautiful bride.  When she and Saurabh made their entrance, all the young people (and some elderly people) surrounded them and started to burst out moves to the live band music.  The colors, the sounds, and the vibrancy were unbelievable.  The ceremony followed did not take long (I must admit that it was hard to pay attention when I could not understand most of what was going on).  I felt like a monkey, clap and throw rice and ooh-ahhh when everybody else did. Worked out well enough though.</p>

<p>Afterward our team presented the couple with our collective gift (a piece of gold), posed for pictures, then came out to the patio for the reception.  We must give big thanks to Shridhar for guiding us through all the confusion and giving disapproving looks to people who tried to cut in front of us.  While we fill up our hungry tummies, Pooja and her husband sat on the throne inside the ceremony room to accept more gifts and blessings.  How awesome is that?</p>

<p>It was spectacular to be able to witness the official joining of two souls. We were very thankful and honored to be included in such a beautiful and special event.</p>

<p>Live long and prosper, Pooja and Saurabh!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first Thanksgiving without families and turkey turned out to be just as amazing spending with friends immersing in Indian cultures and customs. Pooja, Adam&rsquo;s co-worker, was saying goodbye to her single life and we were very honored to be a part of it.</p>

<p>On Thursday night, we celebrated Gobble Gobble day with a hefty load of KFC.  Being the shameful last-minute packers that we are, we only had a three hours sleep before heading to Solapur. Thankfully, the Thoughtworkers team had made all the arrangements for the trip so we only have to drag our zombie bodies down to the front of our complex to meet the bus. We had insider information that it will be there at around 4:15, so we went down at 4:00.  Naturally, the happy thing didn&rsquo;t arrive until 5:00. An hour breathing the fresh morning air wasn&rsquo;t too bad, if not counting all the blood I lost to the dang mosquitoes.</p>

<p>On the way, we stopped for breakfast at a restaurant that has the most flies I have ever seen. But to be fair, the place was very clean and the food was decent.  Maybe the flies just like to sunbathe on the shiny metal tables.  Oh well, you have the right to live and enjoy life as any other creatures on this Earth, friend Flies! (Adam has been reading about Taoism and it&rsquo;s rubbing off on me)</p>

<p>After a five-hour ride, we arrived to a house that Pooja&rsquo;s family has rented for the guests to rest. From the 2nd floor balcony, I felt strangely peaceful watching a man pushing a fruit cart along the side of the field while the cows munching leisurely on some grass.  Below, some of the guys decided for a quick game of cricket in the small paved backyard before getting ready for the ceremony.  Adam and I opted to read instead, sweating profusely did not seem to be a fun start for a wedding.</p>

<li>The planning for Nepal trip in Feb is 95% done.  Tickets booked, hotels/guest houses reserved.  Only thing left is to confirm guide and porter for trekking trip.</li>
<li>Two more weeks until we fly home for the break.  Way behind on Christmas shopping.</li>
<li>Breakfast and lunch are much more comforting now that the food vendors are changed in the cafeteria.  I kept finding hairs in my food with the old ones.  Haizz&hellip; and sometimes I don&rsquo;t think they were hairs from the head.</li>
<li>Favorite Indian starter:  chicken lollipop. Succulent flavorful heaven.</li>
<li>I know I&rsquo;m spoiled when I cannot do business in a swat toilet.  I even sang to coax myself but it didn&rsquo;t work.  Bahhh.</li>
<li>Always bring toilet paper when traveling in India.</li>
<li>I told Adam that it would be cloudy all the time we were in Solapur and Hampi. The result?  He got some serious sunburn.  The lesson? Don&rsquo;t trust Thien to look up the weather.</li>
<li>Cutest Indian saying: &ldquo;click&rdquo;.  They use the word &ldquo;click&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;take picture&rdquo;.  Such as:  &ldquo;Will you click me?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Nice clickworks!&rdquo;</li>
<li>Big banana:  5 rupees each.  Tiny banana:  5 rupees each.  What??? How could that be when they taste equally good? Oh well, bigger is better.</li>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t seen my guava man for almost a week.  I&rsquo;m worried and sad.  But that did not stop me from having an affair with another guava man who sells red-flesh guavas.  I mean, even Bunster does not blame me.</li>
<li>I must confess my shame to maah spoony sister:  I eat McDonald!!!! And I like it.  The McSpicy is so good here.</li>
<li>I think I&rsquo;m starting to like India.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://thienscribbles.com/blog/2014/11/02/lovely-november/"/>
    <updated>2014-11-02T20:09:29+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://thienscribbles.com/blog/2014/11/02/lovely-november</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>November has always been my favorite month of the year.  The air seems sweeter, the sky bluer, and the sun more warm and radiant.  November is the time for pumpkin beer, pumpkin pie, pumpkin and oxtail cous cous, pumpkin ginger bread pudding, Starbucks pumpkin spice latte, pumpkin pancakes (for Adam, Thien eats banana blueberry pancakes), Thanksgiving, first batch of homemade eggnog, and Christmas tree decoration (at Mama&rsquo;s).</p>

<p>If I were in Texas, Adam and papa Fred would make a fire about this time.  Papasito has this awesome fire pit made from an end of a huge propane tank (it has made the list to be the family heirloom). Then we would roast the last of the habaneros and jalapenos from the garden with bacon and cream cheese. The sizzling sound of the bacon fat dripping on the scorching wood usually drives us frenzy.  After gobbling down a whole stuffed habanero in one shot, gung-ho Adam and Rebecca would have to flap their tongues like some nuts while smokes seeping out the their ears (Thien does not de-seed completely, hee hee).  Oh well, since those two would be a little handicapped after that brave episode, more yummies for evil Thien!</p>

<p>November in India does not come with the turning of the leaves but the gorgeous weather brings much comfort to my nostalgia.  Today I woke up at 2:00p.m hungry like a bear.  Adam fed me some chicken momos (dumplings) with hot sauce then we ventured out for some more snacks. It felt so good to be walking under the warm sunlight, observing all the happiness around.  Happy Thien wants to give everybody bear hugs, with drools and paws and everything.  Since I didn&rsquo;t really dare to hug anybody, I took lots of pictures instead.  Of course the Bunster sang the &ldquo;Thien took wayyyyyy too many pictures&rdquo; song, but he&rsquo;ll be thankful when he is creepily old and his memory is dimmed.  Thien will remind you of the good old days, Bunster&hellip; with kick-ass illustrations too!</p>
