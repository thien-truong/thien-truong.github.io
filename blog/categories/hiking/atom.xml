    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There was nothing I wanted more than being able to strip off all my clothes.  The air conditioner didn’t work.  The humidity was unbearable.  Then there was this dang precious train that screeched every thirty seconds, accompanied by some excruciating trembling and bouncing.  All of my bones dislocated.  They rattled in helplessness and agony.  A vicious knock on our cabin’s door woke me up from my frenzy – leaving me sweaty and uncoordinated.  I stared at the ceiling like a lifeless zombie then lazily peeked out the curtains.  Outside the window, luscious greens and the calm river gently sang. They were coaxing the sun out to play; but she ran and hid like a shy maiden behind the clouds.  What a flirt!  But how much I wished I could ride the wind and join them to their secret dance.</p>

<p>We reached Lao Cai at 5:30 in the morning.  The hour-long bus ride to Sapa city felt familiar: the winding two-lane roads with mountains on one side and steep valleys on the other, the fresh smell of the creeping fog, the gentle hands holding, and the Vietnamese mom who tried to shush her son’s fussiness by telling him that he will be eaten by monsters.  The boy curiously stared at me a few time but I frowned and squinted at him!  Oops, that only made him fussier (but he kept coming back for more).  Oh well, zombie Thien doesn’t like yappy children, especially this early in the day.</p>

<p>The bus driver dropped us off and told us in broken English to climb up some stairs then turn either left or right to find the tourist office.  I could barely understand him, but I forgot that I could speak Vietnamese (fail!).  Nevertheless, we found it – a crowded room with various groups preparing for different activities and waiting to depart to different villages.  Our guide was not there yet; he had to walk all the way from his village.  I was happy when the tour agent let us know we can take a shower and have some breakfast while waiting.  Whew, I could no longer stand to smell myself.  If there were an odor test, stinky Thien would lose to a monkey at this point; and that would make for a very unfortunate start of the day.</p>

    <link href="http://thienscribbles.com/blog/2014/12/17/hampi/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-17T23:37:27-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://thienscribbles.com/blog/2014/12/17/hampi</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Modern day <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/241">Hampi</a> was once the last capital of the last great Hindu Kingdom of Vijayanagar (14th-16th Century). Before being conquered by the Deccan Muslim confederacy in 1565 and then later abandoned, the city with its marvelous temples and palaces flourished under the cotton and the spice trade.  Today, the 1600+ surviving structures make Hampi one of the most striking ruins in the world.</p>

<p>After about 300 selfies at the guesthouse&rsquo;s gate, we headed toward the Tungabhadra river and boarded a pink ferry to be taken accross.  I was climbing the steps above the riverbank, enjoying the soothing river breeze when my eyes bulged at the most entrancing and exotic sight:  a snake charmer.  Dressed in a white shirt and a white/blue lungi, the man sat cross-legged and nonchalantly played his pungi to his dancing snake.  My heart jumped out when I saw him reaching over to pet the creepy creature.  He kept trying to wave us closer but I didn&rsquo;t bring enough pants to risk wetting a pair.  As amazing as the experience was, I was relieved to know that the practice of snake charming has been declared unlawful - although it&rsquo;s still active in many rural parts of India.</p>

<p>While we were lost in the feverish frenzy of the snake charmer, our fellow friends had hired four rickshaws for the day.  With limited time, we only visited the most important monuments.  Most require entrance fees, which are significantly higher (about 25 times) for foreigners than Indian citizens or visitors of <a href="http://www.saarc-sec.org/SAARC-Charter/5/">SAARC</a> and <a href="http://www.mea.gov.in/Portal/ForeignRelation/BIMSTEC_Brief_February_2014.pdf">BIMSTEC</a>.  I can see the reason for such differences in price but I could not help but feeling wary.  Even so, the breathtaking and well-maintained structures quickly reconciled my uneasiness.  I regretted that we did not get to see everything; to absorbed these spectacles properly would take at least a week.</p>

<p>We returned to the riverbank just in time to catch the last ferry at around 6:00 p.m.  If we had missed it, we would cross in a <a href="http://hampi.in/coracle-crossings">coracle</a> (a gigantic floating basket) instead, which would have been quite an adventure.  Leaving behind the pink and orange sky at dusk, we once again crossed the empty burnt fields, unknowing of a few interesting events to come that evening.</p>

    <updated>2014-10-10T05:52:57-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://thienscribbles.com/blog/2014/10/10/sinhagad-fort</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since our family vacation to the Grand Canyon last summer, Adam and I have been itching to put our hiking shoes to more use.  We had vowed to not let all the blisters it took to break them in go to waste.  Lucky us, Gurpreet (Adam&rsquo;s coworker) offered to take us to a half-day hiking trip last weekend.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhagad">Sinhagad Fort</a>(The Lion&rsquo;s Fort) lies about 30 kilometers (18 miles) southwest of Pune and rises 1312 meters (4304 feet) above sea level.  Once the site of many important battles, only the traditional gates and broken walls remain today. One could opt to drive all the way to the fort, or stop at the foothills then hike up.</p>

<p>Gurpreet had hiked there a few times already so he suggested that we start early to avoid the afternoon sun.  He picked us up at 5:00 and we reached the base at around 6:00.  His car suffered some serious abuse due to the poor road condition.</p>

<p>The hike up usually takes about an hour; but with my short legs, lack of stamina and excessive picture taking, it took an hour and a half.  The climb was steep but the fresh air, huge batches of wild flowers, and the patience of my companions made everything better.  A long the way, there were a few flimsy huts that sell quick refreshments such as fresh cucumbers, pickles, boiled peanuts, yogurts&hellip;  We passed on the snacks for sanitary reasons but then later shamelessly accepted the granola bar Gurpreet offered when our feet got wobbly on the way down.</p>

<p>From the top we can see all the way to Pune.  The view was spectacular - everything I would have wanted for my engagement pictures if I could do it again.  On the way down, Gurpreet spotted a couple of mountain crabs.  They made me all lustful since I did not really have any shellfish since I got here.  Besides, Adam and I were famished.  Next time, we would not go without some snacks, no matter how short the hike is.</p>
