    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I want to curl into a ball and roll around.  But I can&rsquo;t since my bed is too small and the floor is too hard (and roaches run on it sometimes too). How I wish for some oxtails to gnaw on right now.  This meatless land is making me weak and restless. My teeth are itchy.  I have becoming increasingly bite-ty.  Maybe in another month, even BoBeQue (hehehe) will start to sound good.  Num num.  Nom nom.</p>

<p>So I and the Bunster have decided to make a trip to Nepal the first week of February.  I&rsquo;ve been planning nonstop for the past week.  Now when I close my eyes, all I see are travel search engines and currency converters. The cranky Bunster is excited to go but does not want to hear about any of the planning.  Oh well, don&rsquo;t complain when Thien leads you to a place that serves mountain oyster and tell you that it&rsquo;s fried cheese stick. Hah!  Num num.  Nom nom.</p>

<p>I will go chant Pancakes and be happy!</p>
